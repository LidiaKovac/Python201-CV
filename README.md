# Python-102 - Computer Vision
Hi! My name is Lidia ðŸ‘‹

If you have just stumpled upon this repo while going through my GitHub, welcome! 
This repo is part of a "series" of 101s, in this case 102, because I already have a 101 repo for Python. Now I want to dive a bit deeper in the language and use it for computer vision. 

I am a MERN Stack developer, recently graduated from Strive School. This means I have knowledge of MongoDB (+ Postgres), Express.js, React.js and Node.js.

As part of some autonomous exploration, I am trying out different things. You can find a list of what I have explored so far and what I plan to try next on my GitHub page. 

This is the repository for the basics of Computer Vision. I am following <a href='https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810'>this</a> free course.

Since this course also covers a lot of theory, I have two markdown files, one for the course notes and one for the ideas that come to mind. 

The course's material is written in Matlab but the instructor specified it's possible to make everything in Python using OpenCV and that it's much closer to a real world scenario.
