# Python-102 - Computer Vision
Hi! My name is Lidia ðŸ‘‹

If you have just stumpled upon this repo while going through my GitHub, welcome! 
This repo is part of a "series" of 101s, in this case 102, because I already have a 101 repo for Python. Now I want to dive a bit deeper in the language and use it for computer vision. 

I am a MERN Stack developer, recently graduated from Strive School. This means I have knowledge of MongoDB (+ Postgres), Express.js, React.js and Node.js.

As part of some autonomous exploration, I am trying out different things. You can find a list of what I have explored so far and what I plan to try next on my GitHub page. 

This is the repository for the basics of Computer Vision. I am following <a href='https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810'>this</a> free course.
